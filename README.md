# Bootstrap screen scale

Simple component to use on your bootstrap projects so you can see while developing exactly what's the current size of the screen.

Just remember to link the css file to your html file, and use the structure I've used in the html. Feel free to change the css file for whatever better suits you.

Enjoy!
